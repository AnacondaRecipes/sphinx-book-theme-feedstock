Subject: [PATCH] Relax pydata-sphinx-theme dependency constraint

Change from exact version requirement (==0.15.4) to minimum version
requirement (>=0.15.0) to allow compatibility with available conda
packages. The exact version pin was too restrictive for conda packaging
where only 0.16.1 is available in Anaconda repositories.
